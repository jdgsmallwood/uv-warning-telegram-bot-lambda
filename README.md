# UV Warning Bot - Melbourne

## Summary
During the summer I spend a lot of time thinking about whether it's safe to be outside without a hat / sunscreen. I check ARPANSA all the time to see what the current UV is, and when it is projected to be > 3.0 - when sunsmartness is recommended.

This is a bot that checks ARPANSA for me, and lets me know via Telegram whether it is safe to be outside without sun protection or not.
